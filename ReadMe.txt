A collection of benchmarks for various versions of the AutoHotkey scripting language, as well as the AutoHotkey script used to generate them automatically.

Also includes a script to combine two of these generated summaries into one, to ease comparison between two versions of AutoHotkey.

The benchmarks measure the performance of many aspects and features of the language, ranging from file IO and simulating mouse input to matching regular expressions and referencing dynamic variables.
